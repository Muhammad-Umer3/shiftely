Last-minute call-offs and no-shows are a fact of life in shift-based businesses. Without the right tools, managers spend precious time calling around, updating spreadsheets, and hoping someone can fill in. Shiftely turns that chaos into a few clicks.

## The problem with manual coverage

When you're managing shifts with spreadsheets or paper:

- You don't see who's **available** at a glance
- Swap requests fly around by text or word of mouth
- It's easy to double-book or leave a shift uncovered
- After the fact, you're stuck fixing timesheets and payroll

Small teams feel this especially hard—one missing person can mean overtime, stressed colleagues, or worse, an understaffed shift.

## How Shiftely helps

**1. See availability in one place**

Every employee can set their availability. When you need to fill a slot, you see who's free and who isn't—no guessing or endless group chats.

**2. Shift swap requests built in**

Employees can request swaps or time off from the app. You approve or deny in one place, and the schedule updates automatically. No more "who said they'd cover Tuesday?"

**3. Clear, up-to-date schedules**

Once a swap is approved, the schedule reflects it immediately. Everyone sees the same version—no outdated PDFs or scribbled changes.

**4. Less admin, more focus**

Less time on phone tag and spreadsheet edits means more time on what actually matters: your team and your customers.

If last-minute coverage is eating your time, [give Shiftely a try](/) and see how much simpler it can be.
