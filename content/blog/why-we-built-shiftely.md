Running a small business is hard enough without spending hours every week on shift schedules. We built Shiftely because we kept seeing the same pattern: great teams held back by clunky, manual scheduling.

## What we kept hearing

From cafes and retail shops to clinics and salons, the story was similar:

- "I spend half my Sunday building the schedule in a spreadsheet."
- "We're always one person short and I find out too late."
- "Nobody knows who's working when unless they ask."
- "Swap requests are a mess of texts and sticky notes."

These aren't small annoyances. They burn manager time, create stress, and make it harder to keep good people. We wanted a tool that actually fit how small teams work—simple, fast, and affordable.

## What we wanted Shiftely to be

**Simple first.** No complex setup or training. Add your team, set availability, and generate a schedule. If you can use a spreadsheet, you can use Shiftely—but you'll spend a fraction of the time.

**Built for real life.** Call-offs, swap requests, and last-minute changes are normal. The product had to handle them without turning into a second job. That's why we added features like shift swaps and time-off requests from day one.

**AI that helps, doesn't get in the way.** We use AI to suggest schedules that respect availability and fairness. You stay in control; the tool does the heavy lifting.

**Priced for small business.** No enterprise contracts or per-seat surprises. We want Shiftely to be a no-brainer for teams that can't justify big workforce-management suites.

## Where we're headed

We're just getting started. We're adding more flexibility, smarter suggestions, and deeper integrations based on what our users ask for. If you're wrestling with schedules and spreadsheets, [try Shiftely](/register)—we built it for you.
